Then, the probability that he arrives within 10 minutes of his scheduled departure time is equal to the probability that X is less than or equal to 8:40. We can calculate this probability using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a uniform distribution on the interval [7:50, 8:30].\nStep 3: The CDF of a uniform distribution on the interval [a, b] is given by F(x) = x - a / (b - a), where x is any value in the interval.

Then, we can take the square root of both sides to get $\\sin a = \\pm \\frac{1}{3}$.\nStep 2: Since we want to find $\\cos 2a$, we need to consider two cases: when $\\sin a = \\frac{1}{3}$ and when $\\sin a = -\\frac{1}{3}$. In the first case, we can use the Pythagorean identity to find $\\cos a = \\sqrt{1-\\sin^2 a} = \\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{9}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{8}}{3}$. In the second case, we can again use the Pythagorean identity to find $\\cos a = \\sqrt{1-\\sin^2 a} = \\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{9}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{3}$.\nStep 3: Now we can use the double-angle formula for cosine to find $\\cos 2a = 2\\cos^2 a - 1$.

Since the pheasant has four rings, we can assume that each ring has a thickness of d, such that the total height of the pheasant is h = 4d + r.\nStep 2: Substitute the expression for h into the volume equation to get an expression for the volume of the pheasant. We have V = 4/3 * pi * r^3, so V = 4/3 * pi * r^3 * (1 - 4d/r)^4.\nStep 3: Differentiate the expression for V with respect to d to maximize the volume. To do this, we take the derivative of the expression for V with respect to d using the chain rule and setting it equal to zero. We get dV/dd = -4/3 * pi * r^3 * (4d/r)^3 * (-r/(4d)) = 0. Solving for d gives us d = 2r/5.\nAnswer: D",

Plugging in $x=2$ into the equation $g(x)-f(x-4)=7$ gives $g(2)-f(-2)=7$, so $g(2)-4-f(-2)=7$. Therefore, $g(0)=1-f(-2)$.\nAnswer: D",
